## ❗ Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

```Bash
npm start
```

This command will execute `react-scripts start`. The app is built using `create-react-app so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```Bash
npm run build
```

This command will execute `react-scripts build`. Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app will be ready to deploy!

```Bash

```

This command will execute `react-scripts test`. Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```Bash
npm run dev
```

This command will execute `concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`. For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot of MERN applications as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

```Bash
npm run serve
```

This command will execute `node server`, For running the server file on you can use this command.
